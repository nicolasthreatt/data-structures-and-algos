https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary

Table: Employee
    +-------------+------+
    | Column Name | Type |
    +-------------+------+
    | id          | int  |
    | salary      | int  |
    +-------------+------+
- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write a solution to find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table.

If there are less than n distinct salaries, return null.

Input: 
    Employee table:
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+
    n = 2
Output: 
    +------------------------+
    | getNthHighestSalary(2) |
    +------------------------+
    | 200                    |
    +------------------------+
