https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along
the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:
    * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
    * -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Breadth First Search:
    * Tree traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level.
    * Using a queue to store frontier nodes supports the behavior of this search.

Depth First Search:
    * Tree traversal algorithm that goes deep into a tree exploring for nodes branch by branch.
    * Using a stack to store frontier nodes supports the behavior of this search.
