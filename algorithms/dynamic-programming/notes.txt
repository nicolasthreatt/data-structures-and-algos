Dynamic Programming
    - Intro
        + Technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into subproblems
        + Based on the idea of reusing solutions to subproblems to solve larger problems more efficiently
    - Explanation
        + Useful when a problem exhibits the following characteristics:
            * Overlapping subproblems
                > Occurs when the same subproblems are solved multiple times in the process
                  of solving the larger problem
            * Optimal substructure
                > Means that an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions
                  of its subproblems
        + Apprached in Two Ways
            * Top-Down (Memorization)
                > Start by solving the larger problem and break it down into smaller subproblems
                > As the subproblems are solved, they are stored in a cache (tpyically an array or hash table)
                  so that they can be reused later when needed
                > Before solving a subproblem, the cache is checked to see if it already contains the solution
                  to the subproblem
                    ~ If the solution is found, it is returned from the cache
                - This approach is recursive in nature, as it involves solving the same problem multiple times
                  until the base case is reached.
                > The top-down approach saves time by avoiding redundant computations and reusing previously computed
                  solutions.
            * Bottom-Up
                > Start by solving the smallet subproblems and gradually building up to the larger problem
                > Subproblems are solved in a systematic order, typically in a loop, starting from the base cases
                  and progressing towards the final problem
                > The solutions to the subproblems are stored in a table or an aarray so that they can be reused later
                  when needed
                > By solving the subproblems in a bottom-up manner, its ensured that all necessary subproblems are
                  computed before solving the larger problem
                > This approach is iterative in nature, as it involves solving subproblems iteratively rather than
                  making recursive calls
                > the bottom-up approach avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and is often more efficient
                  in terms of both time and space complexity
