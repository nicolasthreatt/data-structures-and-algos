Climbing Stairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.

In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
        There are two ways to climb to the top.
            1. 1 step + 1 step
            2. 2 steps

Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
        There are three ways to climb to the top.
            1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
            2. 1 step + 2 steps
            3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
    * 1 <= n <= 45
