Recursion:
    - Powerful tool in breaking down complex problems into more manageable segments

3 Laws of Recursion
    1. Must have a base case
    2. Must change its state and move toward its base case
    3. Must call itself, recursively

Stages of a Recursion Algorithm
    - There are two stages of a recursive algorithm
        1. What happens before we hit the base case (winding)
        2. What happens after we hit the base case (unwiding)
    - The turnaround point between winding and unwinding in a recursive algorithm
      is the base case

Traversing Data Structures Using Recursion
    - Traversing a data structure means systematically visiting each item stored within it
    - One common use of recurision is to traverse data structures that have a naturally
      recursive definition
        + A particularly important case of this is the tree data structure
    - Data Structures Suitabe for Recursive Traversal:
        + DOM (Document Object Model) tree
        + XML Trees
        + Singly linked lists
        + File systems
        + Binary search trees
    - Traversing a Linked List Using Recursion
        + A linkedd list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains
          a data cargo with a reference to the next node, which may be null (or None in Python)

Recursion vs. Iteration
    - In principle, you can turn any recursive algorithm into an iterative one and vice versa

Advantages of Recursion
    - Recursion can reduce time complexity
    - Recursion code is often simpler, thus saving costly development time
    - Often a recursive solution involves less code, making debugging and maintenance easier
    - Recusion is ideal for tree traversal

Choosing a Recusrive Solution
    - Important things to consider:
        + Managing memory
        + The exit condition
        + The order in which results will be obtained

Adantages of Iteration
    - Often uses less memory and avoids stack overflow problems
    - Can be more robust
    - Easier for people who don't understand recursion
