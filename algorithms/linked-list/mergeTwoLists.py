https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list.
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
    * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
    * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    * Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
